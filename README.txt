Falcon Airlines is a fake airline database made to practice database programming in Connector/Python. 
The data seen from the program is randomly generated and will randomly generate data into the database each time it is ran.
In order to run this program, you must have python and mysql installed on your computer with a username and password.

How to install:
1. Download the executable file and the database.ini file.
2. Make sure both are present in the same folder, otherwise the program will crash upon executing.
3. Replace the username and password with your mysql's login information in database.ini
4. Execute the program and follow the instructions.

Dependencies:
- Python 3
- MySQL
- database.ini (with your login information)
