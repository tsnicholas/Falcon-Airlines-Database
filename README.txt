Falcon Airlines is a fake airline databse to practice database programming in python. 
The data seen from the program are randomly generated and not real. It will also randomly generate data each time it is ran.

How to install:
1. Download the executable file and the database.ini file.
2. Make sure both are present in the same folder, otherwise the program will crash upon executing.
3. Assuming you have mysql installed, the executable file should do the heavy lifting once you run it for the first time.

Dependencies:
- Python
- MySQL
- database.ini
